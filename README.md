# Node Starter with TypeScript, Jest, and Polka

Simple project setup for building out a node backend project. Uses jest with 100% code coverage, esbuild for transpiling in both jest and for a final build, and a not strict typescript setup.

```
yarn dev // start development
yarn test // run tests
yarn build // build production
```
